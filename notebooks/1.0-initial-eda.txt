Key Insights:
1. **Dataset Size**: The dataset has 37,249 entries with 'clean_comment' (text) and 'category' (sentiment: -1, 0, 1).
2. **Missing Values**: There are 100 missing comments, which need handling (e.g., imputation or removal).
3. **Sentiment Distribution**: The dataset may show class imbalance (check plot); consider oversampling/weighting for modeling.
4. **Text Characteristics**: Word counts vary (check histogram); long comments may need truncation for efficient modeling.
5. **Common Words**: Word clouds and top words highlight frequent terms; consider stop-word removal for better feature extraction.
 

**Positive comments (category 1)**: These tend to have a wider spread in word count, indicating that longer comments are more common in positive sentiments.

**Neutral comments (category 0)**: The distribution shows a relatively lower frequency and is more concentrated around shorter comments compared to positive or negative ones.

**Negative comments (category -1)**: These comments have a distribution somewhat similar to positive comments but with a smaller proportion of longer comments.
 
**Positive comments (category 1)**: The median word count is relatively high, and there are several outliers with longer comments, indicating that positive comments tend to be more verbose.

**Neutral comments (category 0)**: The median word count is the lowest, with a tighter interquartile range (IQR), suggesting that neutral comments are generally shorter.

**Negative comments (category -1)**: The word count distribution is similar to positive comments but with a slightly lower median and fewer extreme outliers.
